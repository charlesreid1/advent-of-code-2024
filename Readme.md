My solutions to Advent of Code problems.

## Python

To run, go to the folder for the corresponding day,
go to the `Python/` subfolder,
modify `input` to match your input provided on the
Advent of Code site (or modify `solution.py` to use
the example input), and run it like so:

```
python3 solution.py
```

If alternative instructions are required, they will be
covered in a Readme in that day's folder.


## Bash

To run, go to the folder for the corresponding day,
go to the `Bash/` subfolder,
modify the `input` to match your input, and run
the solution like so:

```
./solution.sh
```

If alternative instructions are required, they will be
covered in a Readme in that day's folder.
